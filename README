!TO_DO - All of things are not implimented now!

    Starter package for new beginner

This package is designed to build android easily.
Don't scare about toolchian, repo and etc.
This package just create all of things.

We support a ODROID-XU4. and we will support ODROID-C2, ODROID-C1+.

If you don't have git, please install the git and set the basic git configuration.

$ sudo apt -y install git
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"

---- WARNING!! ----
We've used Ubuntu 14.04 64bit with 8GB RAM since other newer versions had some issues while building the Android OS. 
Downloaded Android full source code size is around 58GB. Prepare enough space before building the Android platform.
--------------------

Just typing three commands. In this case, we supposed that build image to odroid-xu4.

$ git clone https://github.com/xiane/nb_pkg.git
$ cd nb_pkg
$ ./make.sh odroidxu4 -p android (-a)

When you install the Oracle jdk6, you have to accept the license.

Write android image to media (eMMC/SD).
You can select the images from emmc, sd2emmc and sd.
I recommand burning self install image to media via etcher. (-https://etcher.io)

Or, you can burning your media via command below.

---- WARNING!! ----
You have to check where is media. In here, we supposed it to /dev/sdc.
--------------------

$ ./write_img.sh odroidxu4 emmc /dev/sdc
